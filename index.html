                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! My name is Kia Kalani, and I am passionate about computer science. I am currently a dedicated student in my final year of studies, pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, and I cannot wait to share with you my journey and experiences.</p>
                <p>From a young age, I have always been captivated by technology and computers. Whether it was playing video games, diving into the world of coding, or exploring the endless possibilities that computers offer, I knew that computer science was my calling. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and gained expertise in areas like algorithms, data structures, and software development.</p>
                <p>During my time in university, I actively participated in several projects and extracurricular activities that have further shaped my skills and knowledge in computer science. From working on game development to participating in hackathons, these experiences not only increased my problem-solving abilities but also taught me the value of collaboration and teamwork in achieving innovative solutions.</p>
                <p>Apart from academics, I have also been involved in Teaching assistant positions, Co-op and internships in tech-related industries. These opportunities allowed me to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world scenarios, further honing my technical skills while also developing a strong work ethic and professional demeanor.</p>
